defmodule ForkWithFlags.Supervisor do
  @moduledoc """
  A [Module-based supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-module-based-supervisors).

  It implements [`Supervisor.child_spec/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Supervisor.html#module-child_spec-1) to describe the supervision tree for the
  `:fork_with_flags` application.

  This module is used internally by the package when the `:fork_with_flags` OTP
  application starts its own supervision tree, which is the default behavior.
  If that is disabled, the user's host application should use this module to start
  the supervision tree directly.

  The main purpose of this API is allow the user's host application to control
  when FunWithFlag's supervision tree is started. This is helpful when the
  package is configured to depend on some of the host application's modules, e.g.
  the `Phoenix.PubSub` process ([as documented](readme.html#pubsub-adapters)).

  More detailed instructions on how to configure this in an application are
  available in the [readme](readme.html#application-start-behaviour).
